Another pet project of mine. I'm gonna be making an abstraction layer between OS syscalls that is supposed to be compatible both windows and linux systems. =]

If this rounds up, maybe I will attempt to integrate some more library specific api's for windowing like X11 and win32, or perhaps try making my own first.
